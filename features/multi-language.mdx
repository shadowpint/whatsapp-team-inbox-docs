## Language-Based Routing

Route conversations to agents who speak the customer's language:

```javascript
{
  "language_routing": {
    "enabled": true,
    "detect_from": "message_content",
    "mappings": {
      "es": "Spanish Team",
      "fr": "French Team",
      "en": "General Support"
    }
  }
}
```

## Best Practices

- Tag team members with language skills
- Set up language-specific teams
- Use native speakers when possible
- Enable fallback to English for rare languages
