- Intercom Professional: **$74/user** × 8 = **$592/month**
- WhatsApp add-on: **$99/month**
- Setup time: **$0** (no setup)
- **Monthly: $691**
- **Annual: $8,292**

### Year 1 with Team Inbox

- Setup time: 4 hours × $50/hour = **$200** (one-time)
- Railway hosting: **$20/month**
- Railway database: **$10/month**
- WhatsApp API: **$100/month** (2,000 conversations)
- Resend emails: **$0/month** (free tier)
- **One-time: $200**
- **Monthly: $130**
- **Annual: $1,560 + $200 = $1,760**

**Year 1 Savings**: $8,292 - $1,760 = **$6,532 saved**

**3-Year Total**:
