## Common Deployment Issues

<Warning>
  If something isn't working, check these common issues:
</Warning>

### Issue: "Database connection failed"

**Solution**:
- Verify `DATABASE_URL` is correctly set

- Verify `WHATSAPP_WEBHOOK_VERIFY_TOKEN` matches in both:
  - Railway environment variables
  - Meta App Dashboard webhook settings
- Check backend service is accessible (visit backend URL in browser)

### Issue: "Messages not appearing in inbox"

**Solution**:
- Check WhatsApp webhook is subscribed to "messages" field
- Verify backend logs in Railway (look for webhook events)
- Ensure `WHATSAPP_PHONE_NUMBER_ID` is correct

### Issue: "Can't log in"

**Solution**:
- Verify admin user was created in database
- Check password hash was generated correctly
- Ensure `JWT_SECRET` is set in backend environment
- Try creating user again with fresh password hash

### Issue: "Push notifications not working"

**Solution**:
