## Setting Up Team Workflows

### Conversation Assignment Strategies

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Manual Assignment">
    **Best for**: Small teams (2-5 people)

    **How it works**:
    1. New conversation appears in shared inbox
    2. Team member manually assigns to themselves
    3. They handle until resolved

    **Pros**:
    - ✅ Simple and flexible
    - ✅ Team members choose based on availability
    - ✅ Works well with specialized knowledge

    **Cons**:
    - ⚠️ Can lead to cherry-picking
    - ⚠️ May have uneven distribution
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="Round-Robin">
    **Best for**: Medium teams (5-15 people)

    **How it works**:
    1. New conversation arrives
    2. System automatically assigns to next agent in rotation
    3. Agent receives notification

    **Pros**:
    - ✅ Even distribution of workload
    - ✅ Fair for all team members
    - ✅ No conversations missed

    **Cons**:
    - ⚠️ Doesn't account for agent expertise
    - ⚠️ Doesn't consider current workload
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="Skills-Based">
    **Best for**: Large teams (15+ people) with specializations

    **How it works**:
    1. Tag conversation by type (Sales, Support, etc.)
    2. Route to team members with that skill
    3. Round-robin within skill group

    **Pros**:
    - ✅ Right expert handles each conversation
    - ✅ Better customer experience
    - ✅ Faster resolution times

    **Cons**:
    - ⚠️ Requires tagging setup
    - ⚠️ More complex configuration
  </Tab>
</Tabs>
