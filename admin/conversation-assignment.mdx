## Overview

Intelligent conversation assignment ensures customers get help quickly from the right team member. Configure assignment rules to balance workload and route conversations based on expertise, availability, and business logic.

## Assignment Strategies

    Assign to agents with lowest workload

  </Card>
</CardGroup>

## Round Robin Assignment

Evenly distribute conversations in rotation:

```javascript
{
  "strategy": "round_robin",
  "settings": {
    "skip_offline": true,
    "skip_at_capacity": true,
    "max_concurrent_per_agent": 10,
    "reset_on": "daily" // or "weekly", "monthly"
  }
}
```

**How it works:**
1. New conversation arrives
2. System checks next agent in rotation
3. If agent is available and under capacity, assign
4. Otherwise, move to next agent
5. Cycle repeats

**Best for:** Teams with similar skill levels handling general inquiries.

## Load-Based Assignment

Assign to the agent with the fewest active conversations:

```javascript
{
  "strategy": "load_balanced",
  "settings": {
    "consider_priority": true,
    "priority_weight": {
      "urgent": 3,
      "high": 2,
      "normal": 1,
      "low": 0.5
    },
    "max_per_agent": 15,
    "rebalance_threshold": 5 // Reassign if difference >5
  }
}
```

**Calculation example:**
```
Agent   Active  Weighted Load  Next Assignment?
Sarah   8       12 (6×2 high)  No
John    5       5 (all normal) ✓ Yes (lowest)
Alice   7       11 (4×2 + 3×1) No
```

**Best for:** Varying conversation complexity, keeping team balanced.

## Skill-Based Routing

Route based on agent expertise:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Define Skills">
    ```
    Skills Configuration
    ━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

    Technical Support
    ├─ Members: Alice, Bob, Charlie
    └─ Auto-assign when tags: technical, bug, api

    Billing
    ├─ Members: Sarah, Diana
    └─ Auto-assign when tags: billing, payment, refund

    Sales
    ├─ Members: John, Emma
    └─ Auto-assign when tags: sales, demo, pricing

    General Support (Fallback)
    └─ All active agents
    ```
  </Step>

  <Step title="Tag Conversations">
    Tags trigger skill-based routing:
    ```
    Customer message: "My API integration is broken"

    Auto-tagging detects: "technical", "api"
    → Routes to Technical Support team
    → Assigns to Alice (least busy technical agent)
    ```
  </Step>

  <Step title="Configure Fallback">
    ```javascript
    {
      "skill_routing": {
        "enabled": true,
        "fallback_strategy": "round_robin",
        "fallback_after_seconds": 120,
        "allow_cross_skill": true // If all specialists busy
      }
    }
    ```
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Priority-Based Assignment

VIP customers get premium treatment:

```javascript
{
  "priority_routing": {
    "enabled": true,
    "rules": [
      {
        "condition": {
          "tags": ["VIP", "Enterprise"],
          "or": true
        },
        "assign_to": {
          "agents": ["senior-agent@company.com"],
          "fallback_team": "Tier 2 Support",
          "max_wait_seconds": 60
        },
        "notify": {
          "method": ["desktop", "email", "sms"],
          "message": "VIP customer needs assistance"
        }
      },
      {
        "condition": {
          "priority": "urgent",
          "unassigned_for_seconds": 300
        },
        "escalate_to": "team_lead",
        "notify_manager": true
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

## Advanced Assignment Rules

### Time-Based Routing

Route based on time of day:

```javascript
{
  "time_based_routing": {
    "timezone": "America/New_York",
    "rules": [
      {
        "days": ["Monday", "Tuesday", "Wednesday", "Thursday", "Friday"],
        "hours": { "start": "09:00", "end": "17:00" },
        "assign_to_team": "Day Shift",
        "strategy": "load_balanced"
      },
      {
        "days": ["Monday", "Tuesday", "Wednesday", "Thursday", "Friday"],
        "hours": { "start": "17:00", "end": "21:00" },
        "assign_to_team": "Evening Shift",
        "strategy": "round_robin"
      },
      {
        "days": ["Saturday", "Sunday"],
        "hours": { "start": "10:00", "end": "18:00" },
        "assign_to_team": "Weekend Support",
        "max_per_agent": 5
      }
    ],
    "fallback": {
      "outside_hours": "create_ticket", // or "assign_to_on_call"
      "auto_response": "We're currently offline. We'll respond when we're back."
    }
  }
}
```

### Language-Based Routing

Assign based on customer language:

```javascript
{
  "language_routing": {
    "enabled": true,
    "detect_from": ["message_content", "contact_preference"],
    "mappings": {
      "es": {
        "team": "Spanish Support",
        "agents": ["maria@company.com", "carlos@company.com"]
      },
      "fr": {
        "team": "French Support",
        "fallback_to_english": true
      },
      "en": {
        "team": "General Support"
      }
    },
    "fallback": "General Support"
  }
}
```

### Customer History Routing

Route to previous agent:

```javascript
{
  "history_routing": {
    "enabled": true,
    "prefer_previous_agent": true,
    "within_days": 30,
    "conditions": {
      "previous_csat": ">= 4", // Only if good experience
      "agent_available": true,
      "agent_under_capacity": true
    },
    "fallback": "load_balanced"
  }
}
```

## Reassignment Rules

Automatic reassignment triggers:

```javascript
{
  "auto_reassignment": {
    "enabled": true,
    "triggers": [
      {
        "condition": "agent_no_response",
        "timeout_minutes": 15,
        "action": "reassign_to_available",
        "notify_manager": true
      },
      {
        "condition": "agent_goes_offline",
        "action": "reassign_active_conversations",
        "to": "team_members",
        "max_to_reassign": 5
      },
      {
        "condition": "conversation_unresolved",
        "timeout_hours": 24,
        "escalate_to": "senior_agent",
        "increase_priority": true
      },
      {
        "condition": "customer_requests_reassignment",
        "action": "assign_to_team_lead",
        "flag_for_review": true
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

## Testing Assignment Rules

Simulate assignments before enabling:

```
Assignment Rule Tester
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

Test Scenario:
Customer: VIP customer from previous conversation
Tags: technical, urgent
Time: Monday 3:00 PM EST
Language: English
Priority: Urgent

Current Team State:
Sarah (Technical): 5 active, available
John (General): 3 active, available
Alice (Technical): 10 active, at capacity

Test Result:
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
✓ Would assign to: Sarah Johnson

Reasoning:
1. VIP + Urgent → Priority routing
2. Technical tag → Skill-based routing
3. Sarah: Technical skill + under capacity
4. Assignment time: < 30 seconds
