| Metric | Target | Warning | Critical |
|--------|--------|---------|----------|
| API Response Time | &lt;200ms | &gt;500ms | &gt;1000ms |

## Troubleshooting Common Launch Issues

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Messages not being received">
    **Quick Checks:**
    1. Verify webhook URL is accessible via HTTPS
    2. Check webhook verification token matches
    3. Review WhatsApp webhook logs in Meta dashboard
    4. Verify phone number ID is correct
    5. Check application logs for webhook errors

    **Debug:**
    ```bash
    # Test webhook endpoint
    curl -X POST https://yourdomain.com/api/webhooks/whatsapp \
      -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
      -d '{"entry": [{"changes": [{"value": {"messages": []}}]}]}'

    # Should return 200 OK
    ```
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="High response times">
    **Common Causes:**
    - Database queries not optimized
    - Missing database indexes
    - Connection pool exhausted
    - Memory leak
    - Network latency

    **Solutions:**
    ```sql
    -- Find slow queries
    SELECT query, mean_exec_time, calls
    FROM pg_stat_statements
    ORDER BY mean_exec_time DESC
    LIMIT 10;

    -- Add missing indexes
    -- Check query execution plans
    EXPLAIN ANALYZE SELECT ...;
    ```
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Database connection errors">
    **Solutions:**
    1. Increase connection pool size
    2. Enable connection pooling (PgBouncer)
    3. Fix connection leaks in code
    4. Scale database instance

    ```bash
    # Check active connections
    SELECT count(*) FROM pg_stat_activity;

    # Increase pool size in .env
    DATABASE_POOL_MAX=50
    ```
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Memory usage growing">
    **Investigate:**
    ```bash
    # Monitor Node.js memory
    node --inspect app.js

    # Or use PM2
    pm2 monit

    # Look for memory leaks
    # Take heap snapshots at intervals
    ```

    **Common Causes:**
    - Not closing database connections
    - Event listeners not removed
    - Large objects in memory
    - Cache growing unbounded

    **Solutions:**
    1. Implement proper cleanup
    2. Set cache size limits
    3. Use streaming for large data
    4. Restart periodically (cron job)
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="SSL/HTTPS errors">
    **Check Certificate:**
    ```bash
    # Test SSL configuration
    openssl s_client -connect yourdomain.com:443

    # Check certificate expiry
    echo | openssl s_client -connect yourdomain.com:443 2>/dev/null | openssl x509 -noout -dates

    # SSL Labs test
    # Visit: https://www.ssllabs.com/ssltest/
    ```

    **Renew Certificate (Let's Encrypt):**
    ```bash
    sudo certbot renew
    sudo systemctl reload nginx
    ```
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Rollback Procedure

If critical issues occur, follow this rollback process:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Assess Situation">
    - Identify the critical issue
    - Determine impact and affected users
    - Decide if rollback is necessary
    - Notify team of rollback decision
  </Step>

  <Step title="Initiate Rollback">
    ```bash
    # Stop current application
    pm2 stop team-inbox

    # Restore previous version
    git checkout <previous-stable-tag>

    # Restore dependencies
    npm ci

    # Rollback database if needed
    npx prisma migrate resolve --rolled-back <migration-name>

    # Restart with previous version
    pm2 start team-inbox
    ```
  </Step>

  <Step title="Verify Rollback">
    - Test critical functionality
    - Verify messages being received
    - Check error rates
    - Confirm system stability
  </Step>

  <Step title="Post-Rollback">
    - Notify customers (if customer-facing impact)
    - Document issues encountered
    - Plan fixes for identified issues
    - Schedule new deployment with fixes
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Cost Monitoring

Track costs from day one to avoid surprises:

  </Card>
  <Card title="Third-party Services" icon="plug">
    Track costs for monitoring, logging, etc.
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

Set up billing alerts:
```bash
# AWS CloudWatch billing alarm example
aws cloudwatch put-metric-alarm \
  --alarm-name team-inbox-billing \
  --alarm-description "Alert when costs exceed $100" \
  --metric-name EstimatedCharges \
  --namespace AWS/Billing \
  --statistic Maximum \
  --period 21600 \
  --evaluation-periods 1 \
  --threshold 100 \
  --comparison-operator GreaterThanThreshold
```

## Optimization Tips

<Accordion title="Database Optimization">
  - Run `VACUUM ANALYZE` weekly
  - Monitor and add indexes as needed
  - Archive old conversations (>6 months)
  - Use read replicas for reporting
  - Enable query caching
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Application Optimization">
  - Enable Redis caching for frequently accessed data
  - Implement lazy loading for large lists
  - Optimize database queries (use SELECT specific columns)
  - Batch webhook processing
  - Use CDN for static assets
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Cost Optimization">
  - Respond to WhatsApp messages within 24 hours (free window)
  - Use read replicas instead of scaling primary DB
  - Implement message batching for emails
  - Right-size server resources
  - Use spot instances where applicable
</Accordion>
