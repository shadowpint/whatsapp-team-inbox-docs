## The Problem With Traditional Customer Support Platforms

Traditional customer support platforms like Intercom, Zendesk, and Front charge **per agent per month**. As your team grows, costs spiral out of control:

<Warning>
  A 10-person support team on Intercom costs **$740/month** minimum. With enterprise features, this can exceed **$2,000/month**.
</Warning>

Beyond pricing, there are deeper issues:

    Your customer data lives on their servers. Migration is painful and expensive.

  <Card title="Limited Customization" icon="ban">
    Features are what they decide. Custom workflows require expensive enterprise plans.

    Customer conversations contain sensitive data. Third-party access creates compliance risks.

  <Card title="Unpredictable Costs" icon="chart-line-up">
    Per-agent pricing means every team member adds to your monthly bill.

## The Self-Hosted Advantage

WhatsApp Team Inbox flips this model on its head:

### 1. Own Your Data Completely

<Info>
  All customer conversations, contact information, and analytics stay in **your database** on **your infrastructure**.
</Info>

This means:
- ✅ Full GDPR/CCPA compliance control
- ✅ Meet data residency requirements for any region
- ✅ Zero third-party access to customer data
- ✅ Export or migrate anytime, instantly

### 2. Predictable, Fixed Costs

| Team Size | Traditional SaaS | Team Inbox (Self-Hosted) | Savings |
|-----------|-----------------|-------------------------|---------|
| 5 agents  | $370-500/month  | $80-300/month          | ~$200/month |
| 10 agents | $740-1000/month | $80-300/month          | ~$600/month |
| 20 agents | $1480-2000/month| $80-300/month          | ~$1,500/month |

<Note>
  Team Inbox costs stay flat regardless of team size. Add unlimited agents without changing your monthly bill.
</Note>
