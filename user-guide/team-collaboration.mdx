## Communication Guidelines

### Response Time Expectations

Set clear expectations:

| Mention Type | Expected Response | Example |
|--------------|------------------|---------|
| Urgent @mention | &lt;15 minutes | @john URGENT: VIP customer issue |
| Normal @mention | &lt;2 hours | @sarah Can you review this? |
| FYI mention | No response needed | @team FYI: System maintenance tonight |

### Handoff Protocol

Standard process for conversation transfers:

1. **Add context** in notes
2. **@Mention** new agent
3. **Wait for acknowledgment** (or escalate if urgent)
4. **Notify customer** about transfer
5. **Monitor** until new agent responds

### Escalation Path

When to escalate and to whom:

```
Level 1: Team Lead
├─ Can't resolve in 30 min
├─ Customer requesting manager
└─ Policy exceptions needed

Level 2: Department Manager
├─ Complex technical issues
├─ Billing disputes >$X
└─ Legal concerns

Level 3: Executive Team
├─ PR/reputation issues
├─ Large account problems
└─ System-wide failures
```
