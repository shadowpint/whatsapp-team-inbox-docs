## Overview

Effective conversation management is key to providing excellent customer service. This guide covers advanced techniques for handling multiple conversations, prioritizing work, and resolving issues quickly.

## Conversation Lifecycle

Understanding the conversation flow helps you manage customer interactions effectively:

**New Message → Open → Assigned → In Progress → Resolved → Closed → Archived**

<Steps>
  <Step title="New Conversation">
    When a customer messages you, the conversation appears in your inbox with a notification sent to your team.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Assignment">
    Assign conversations to the right team member based on expertise, workload, or previous interactions.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Active Handling">
    Team members respond to customers, gather information, resolve issues, and update status.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Resolution">
    Close the conversation when resolved by marking as complete and adding resolution notes.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Assignment Strategies

### Manual Assignment

Assign specific conversations to team members:

1. Open conversation
2. Click **Assign** button
3. Select team member from dropdown
4. Add assignment note (optional)
5. Click **Assign**

### Self-Assignment

Team members can claim conversations from the unassigned queue:

1. Browse unassigned conversations
2. Click conversation to preview
3. Click **Assign to Me**

### Automatic Assignment

Enable smart auto-assignment based on rules:

- **Skill-Based**: Route based on agent expertise
- **VIP Routing**: Prioritize high-value customers

## Prioritization

### Priority Levels

Organize conversations by urgency:

| Priority | SLA Target | Description |
|----------|------------|-------------|
| Urgent | Less than 1 hour | Critical issues, VIP customers |
| High | Less than 4 hours | Important but not critical |
| Normal | Less than 24 hours | Standard inquiries |
| Low | Less than 48 hours | General questions |

### Setting Priority

Set priority for individual conversations:
