## Overview

Effective conversation management is key to providing excellent customer service. This guide covers advanced techniques for handling multiple conversations, prioritizing work, and resolving issues quickly.

## Conversation Lifecycle

Understanding the conversation flow helps you manage customer interactions effectively:

```
New Message → Open → Assigned → In Progress → Resolved → Closed → Archived
                ↑                     ↓
                └─────────────────────┘
                  (if customer replies)
```

<Steps>
  <Step title="New Conversation">
    When a customer messages you:
    - Conversation appears in inbox
    - Notification sent to team
    - Auto-assignment triggered (if enabled)
    - Status set to "Open"
  </Step>

  <Step title="Assignment">
    Assign to the right team member:
    - Based on expertise
    - Current workload
    - Language skills
    - Previous interactions
  </Step>

  <Step title="Active Handling">
    Team member works on the conversation:
    - Responds to customer
    - Gathers information
    - Resolves issue
    - Updates status
  </Step>

  <Step title="Resolution">
    Close the conversation when resolved:
    - Mark as resolved
    - Add resolution notes
    - Tag appropriately
    - Follow up if needed
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Assignment Strategies

### Manual Assignment

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Direct Assignment">
    Assign specific conversations to team members:

    1. Open conversation
    2. Click **Assign** button
    3. Select team member from dropdown
    4. (Optional) Add assignment note
    5. Click **Assign**

    **When to use:**
    - Customer requests specific agent
    - Specialized expertise needed
    - Conversation continuation
    - VIP customers
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="Self-Assignment">
    Team members claim conversations:

    1. Browse unassigned conversations
    2. Click conversation to preview
    3. Click **Assign to Me**
    4. Start responding

    **When to use:**
    - Open queue system
    - Team has balanced skills
    - Flexible workload distribution
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="Reassignment">
    Transfer conversation to another agent:

    1. Open conversation
    2. Click current assignee name
    3. Select new team member
    4. Add handoff note:
       ```
       Customer needs help with [specific issue].
       Already tried: [attempted solutions]
       Next step: [recommended action]
       ```
    5. Confirm transfer

    **Best practice:** Always add context when reassigning.
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

### Automatic Assignment

Enable smart auto-assignment based on rules:

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Round Robin">
    Distribute conversations evenly across team:

    **Configuration:**
    ```javascript
    {
      "strategy": "round_robin",
      "skip_offline": true,
      "max_concurrent": 10
    }
    ```

    **How it works:**
    1. New conversation arrives
    2. System checks next agent in rotation
    3. Assigns if agent is available
    4. Moves to next agent if unavailable
    5. Repeats cycle
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Load Balancing">
    Assign to agent with fewest active conversations:

    **Configuration:**
    ```javascript
    {
      "strategy": "load_based",
      "consider_priority": true,
      "max_per_agent": 15
    }
    ```

    **Factors considered:**
    - Current conversation count
    - Agent status (available, busy, away)
    - Conversation priority
    - Agent capacity limit
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Skill-Based">
    Route based on agent expertise:

    **Configuration:**
    ```javascript
    {
      "strategy": "skill_based",
      "skills": {
        "billing": ["alice@company.com", "bob@company.com"],
        "technical": ["charlie@company.com"],
        "sales": ["diana@company.com"]
      },
      "fallback": "round_robin"
    }
    ```

    **Setup:**
    1. Define skill categories
    2. Tag agents with skills
    3. Tag conversations with topics
    4. System matches automatically
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="VIP Routing">
    Prioritize high-value customers:

    **Configuration:**
    ```javascript
    {
      "strategy": "vip_routing",
      "vip_tags": ["premium", "enterprise"],
      "vip_agents": ["senior-agent@company.com"],
      "priority_boost": true
    }
    ```

    **How to mark VIP:**
    1. Add "VIP" tag to contact
    2. Set custom field: `customer_tier: "premium"`
    3. System routes to designated agents
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Prioritization

### Priority Levels

Organize conversations by urgency:

| Priority | Description | SLA Target | Indicators |
|----------|-------------|------------|------------|
| 🔴 Urgent | Critical issues, VIP customers | <1 hour | Red badge, top of list |
| 🟡 High | Important but not critical | <4 hours | Yellow badge, high position |
| 🟢 Normal | Standard inquiries | <24 hours | No badge, standard position |
| ⚪ Low | General questions | <48 hours | Gray badge, lower position |

### Setting Priority

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Manual Priority">
    Set priority for individual conversations:

    1. Open conversation
    2. Click priority badge
    3. Select level
    4. Add priority reason (optional)

    **Auto-escalation:**
    Conversations automatically escalate if:
    - No response within SLA window
    - Customer sends multiple follow-ups
    - Contains urgent keywords
    - VIP customer
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="Smart Priority">
    Enable AI-powered priority detection:

    ```javascript
    {
      "auto_prioritize": true,
      "urgent_keywords": ["urgent", "asap", "emergency", "broken"],
      "sentiment_analysis": true,
      "escalation_rules": {
        "no_response_hours": 4,
        "follow_up_count": 3
      }
    }
    ```

    System analyzes:
    - Message content and keywords
    - Customer sentiment
    - Response time elapsed
    - Previous interaction history
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

### Priority Queue Management

View and work through priority queues:

```
My Inbox
├── 🔴 Urgent (3)
│   ├── Server down - Customer A
│   ├── Payment failed - VIP Customer
│   └── Angry customer - refund issue
├── 🟡 High Priority (7)
├── 🟢 Normal (15)
└── ⚪ Low Priority (5)
```

**Best practice:** Work top-down through priority levels.
